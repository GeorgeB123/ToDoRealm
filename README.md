To Do App using Realm Database

My attempt at creating a functional todo app using the Realm database.

Can be sorted by word search, priority of job or date.

To add a task, simply click the add icon and enter whatever you would like. To edit, just touch the task you have already added and you can edit. To delete, swipe right on a cell and the delete option will appear.
